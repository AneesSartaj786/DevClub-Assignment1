        <h2>Suggestions If You Have These Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.</li>
            <li>People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.</li>
            <li>On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days.</li>

        <h2>Prevention Tips</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.</li>
            <li>    Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
            <li>Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.</li>
            <li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li>Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.</li>
            <li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.</li>
            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> IS COVID-19 WORSE THAN FLU?
                <ul>
                    <li>COVID-19 has a higher rate of severe disease and mortality in nearly every age group, compared with influenza (flu).</li>
                    <li>John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health reported that “COVID-19 has killed more people in the US than flu has in the last five years.”</li>
                    <li>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that in the United States flu has resulted in “between 12,000-61,000 deaths annually since 2010.” COVID-19 has resulted in more than 304,000 deaths in the US. </li>


                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> HOW EFFECTIVE ARE MASKS AND DO THEY ALSO NEED TO COVER MY NOSE?
                <ul>
                    <li>Mask wearing is a very simple and effective way to reduce transmission and save lives. The degree of protection depends on the type of mask, how well they worn and on other factors such as the behaviour of people wearing them and the behaviour of air droplets in different settings.</li>
                    <li>Masks alone are not enough to fully protect someone from the virus, but they still have an essential role to play in protecting high risk individuals, such as frontline health care workers. For most people the greatest benefit lies not in protecting the wearer, but those around them. When combined with other safety measures like physical distancing and practicing good hygiene, they are a very effective tool with little to no disruption to normal life.</li>
                    <li>Using a mask to just cover the mouth and not the nose only addresses part of risk, and so could defeat the whole purpose of wearing one in the first place. Similarly, eye protection can also be important, particularly when physical distancing isn’t possible</li>


                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE HERD IMMUNITY WITHOUT VACCINES?
                <ul>
                    <li>Historically, the most successful way to achieve herd immunity is actually through mass vaccination. This is a much safer route as the alternative is for roughly 60% of the population to be infected with COVID-19 which essentially means leaving the virus unchecked.</li>
                    <li>Attempting to achieve natural herd immunity through infection will lead to a rise in cases, and a surge in the number of deaths. Moreover, natural immunity to coronaviruses usually only lasts for up to a couple of years. As Kristian Andersen, an immunologist at the Scripps Research Institute in California warned, this approach could “lead to unacceptable and unnecessary untold human death and suffering.” </li>
                    


                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> HOW CAN WE TRUST VACCINES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED SO FAST?
                <ul>
                    <li>COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and produced in record time, but it’s also involved unprecedented levels of funding and global cooperation to tackle a global threat. So far, all approved COVID-19 vaccines have undergone large clinical trials with rigorous safety protocols, and without major safety concerns raised.</li>
                    
                    


                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF RE-INFECTION?

                <ul>
                    <li>Even if you have had a test that detects antibodies, reinfection is still possible, although less likely.</li>
                    <li>Antibodies are only one part of the vast, complex immune response that is set in motion when a person becomes infected with a virus like SARS-CoV-2 so having antibodies isn’t enough to guarantee long-term protection.</li>
                    <li>In many people, infection with SARS-CoV-2 can lead to so-called ‘long COVID’ – where people suffer long-term complications resulting from the virus. This can be caused directly by the virus replicating over long periods, or indirectly with symptoms, like fatigue, waxing and waning even after the virus is present in their body.</li>


                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>  IS REGULARLY WASHING MY HANDS ENOUGH TO PROTECT ME?
                <ul>
                    <li>Even though regularly washing your hands is very important, as with masks it is not enough on its own. Public health guidelines all work in tandem to prevent the spread of germs.</li>
                    
                    

                </ul>
